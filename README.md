## Introduction

_Long time ago someone asked me to define myself with one word, and I concluded that the word that defines me is curious, I'm a curious man.
It might not be such a popular way to define someone, but it's definitely a great place to start if you want to understand things.
From the Truth to the answer to a math problem, they all can be found if you're curious.
When curiosity hits its not a matter of being right or wrong, but of knowing, of understanding, and improving._

_That's why my goal is set in finding new ways to help the community. I strongly believe that software is and will always be a tool to improve humanity.
I hope to eventually become a Senior Developer, and who knows? maybe even make my own game one day._
